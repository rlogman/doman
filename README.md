# Doman Application

This application is a platform to create cards - [Bits of inteligence](http://www.gentlerevolution.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=BOT) - and teach the kids.

## About the Metodology

[Glenn Doman](http://www.iahp.org/about-us/about-glenn-doman) is the founder of [The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP)](http://www.iahp.org)

[The Gentle Revolution](http://www.gentlerevolution.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=SFNT&Store_Code=G) started with the book How To Teach Your Baby To Read. When it first appeared it not only created quite a sensation but it helped to unleash the creativity of parents. The first thing every parent learns is that when you start to teach your baby, the baby wants more and he wants more right now. Meeting that demand has not been easy, but it has been the right problem to have because it means we are doing something right.

## Run the Application

Server Application : http://localhost/server/

Api EndPoint: http://localhost/doman/server/service/api/www/index.php/v1

## The Client application uses Auth0. What is Auth0?

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account

1. Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup) and click Sign Up.
